# Readme.md

This is the source repository for [Sumo Logic Developers] (https://sumologic.github.io), a site built to showcase some of the cool open-source projects that are being built in and around Sumo Logic. The goal is to share the knowledge and many projects that are being built by our customers, partners and 3rd-party developers. The site is built on Github pages using Jekyll as a static site generator. If you're not familiar with them, Github pages are served from a special repository associated with your User or Organization account on Github. Github pages supports Jekyll natively so itâ€™s easy to run builds on your local machine and review changes on a localhost before deploying to Github. See the Github help pages and Jekyll documentation for more information.

The site itself is maintained by Sumo Logic. Community members are encourgaed to suggest additions to the Experts and Integrations pages, which list open-source projects related to Sumo Logic. Contributors can update these listings by editing an appropriate .yml data file. See CONTRIBUTORS for more information.
